I prompt the menu of choices in a loop

I do a case check depending on what you type as a choice

I don't know how to do a file reader outside a method that throws FileNotFoundException,
so I was unable to get other methods such as getStockHigh and getStockLow to work properly

I, for some reason, just can't work well with file reading, so this program really confused me




I tried to get some help, but I still don't understand enough about files and if they need a specific format

I don't know how the file is going to be formatted because you didn't give an example
so im confused on how I would be able to write this code effectively if I don't know
the layout of the file

I had't finished the code because I spent a lot of time workng on other work and studying
for a calculus test and a public speaking speech for this week. I'm sorry if I have been 
not up to the standards you expect in a good student, I just have a lot of stuff going on
for this specific semester.

I had also missed homework 1 part A, but that was because of me having a bad habit of procrastinating
nothing to do with anything else. Sorry once again.
